# Cattle Manager App

Cattle Manager is a comprehensive Flutter application designed to help farmers and ranchers efficiently manage their cattle operations. The app provides tools for tracking cattle, milk production, health events, feed costs, and generating reports.

## Problem Statement
Indian dairy farmers rely heavily on traditional, manual record-keeping methods. This leads to:
- Errors in tracking milk deliveries and payments.
- Missed pregnancy cycles, heat tracking, and vaccinations.
- Increased workload, reducing efficiency.
- Paid livestock management apps that are expensive and inaccessible for small farmers.

## Our Solution
We are developing a free, user-friendly livestock management app designed specifically for Indian farmers. Our app will help farmers:
- **Digitally track milk deliveries:** Automatically update records when milk is delivered or skipped.
- **Manage finances effortlessly:** Generate bills and calculate payments instantly.
- **Monitor livestock health:** Get reminders for vaccinations, pregnancy cycles, and heat tracking.
- **Offline Access:** Farmers in rural areas can use it without needing continuous internet.
- **Multi-language Support:** Available in Hindi, Gujarati, Marathi, and other regional languages to ensure ease of use.

## Why Us?
- **Focused on affordability:** Unlike existing paid apps, ours is free for farmers.
- **Localized for Indian farmers:** Designed with simple Hindi/Gujarati/Marathi interface options.
- **Practical and efficient:** Built based on real challenges faced by farmers like my uncle.
- **Scalable and Expandable:** Future updates can include AI-based health monitoring, predictive analytics for milk yield, and integration with government schemes.

## Market Potential & Scalability
India has over 75 million dairy farmers, and the dairy industry contributes significantly to the economy. With increasing smartphone penetration in rural areas, our app has the potential to reach millions of farmers, improving productivity and profitability.

## Conclusion
With our app, we aim to revolutionize livestock management for Indian farmers, making dairy farming smarter, more efficient, and stress-free. By leveraging technology to solve real problems, we can help farmers focus on growth rather than manual work.

## Development

### Project Structure
- `lib/models/` - Data models (Cattle, Event, FeedCost, etc.).
- `lib/screens/` - UI screens for different features.
- `lib/services/` - Business logic and data handling.
- `lib/utils/` - Utility functions and constants.
- `assets/lang/` - Localization files.

### Localization
The app uses JSON files for translation. To add a new language:
1. Create a new JSON file in `assets/lang/` with the language code (e.g., `fr.json`).
2. Add the new locale to the supported locales in `main.dart`.
3. Update the `isSupported` method in `app_localizations.dart`.
